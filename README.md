# HBKD-81
A Open hardware, ZX81 keyboard and case design, based off modern availible parts.

OK, So this is a rough commit so everybody has a chance to get production going on the keyboard PCB.
this project has many parts so I want to make sure that we don't loose time on something by sitting 
on designs until the next phase is ready.

additionally, a lot of people have really expressed interest in just getting a keyboard pcb.

Here is the design info with some Caveats: 
 - This is CERN-OHL-P - see the very easy to understand open hardware license 
 - I don't make any grantees or warrantees; see the legal disclaimers below
 - I don't intednd to sell a product here just sharing what I have, that being 
   said.  I am an armature, there may be mistakes but my boards worked right
   out of the box.  additionally i do have experience in home brew and hobby computers
   electronics (formal trade school training) and I try to test everything out.
 - No BOM as of yet, but that hopefully completed by the end of the week.  some
   details of what I ordered so far are on the hack a day.  (actually updating the 
   repo on my lunch break at work!)
