These are the cad files.

A few detials, The 2d cad files do not specify thickness.  The PT-10 Drawings state .062" 
thick aluminium.  If you are doing the top panel, a 2MM (.072") pannel was used in the 
prototype (as thats the actual depth of the cavity.) A 1.6mm panel is going to be weaker 
and there will be a lip at the edge of the cavity.

the back pannel is actually a lot closer to .062".  If you get ambitious and combine the two 
pannels on the same sheet, you are going to run into problems makeing the back pannel fit at
2MM.  I made it work but its very tight fit.   If you wind up customizeing the pannel with cut
outs its going to crack if you try to force it with any amount of structural cut outs.  For
the back pannel I recomend using 1.57 to 1.6mm thick material. 

I pulled all of the factory installed Tinnerman Fasteners off the case, they got in the way.
you can use them with machine screws but I just ended up using m3 size screws everywhere.
if you just order the case without pannels (I recomend this, you aren't useing them) It won't 
come with them installed (or shouldn't). The PT-10 drawings specify this as part 61691-02.

I used a standard kit of vynal m3 stand offs and screws off of amazon. I didn't keep track of 
the sizing.  I used a threded post stand off and nuts to hold the PCB to the top panel
with a screw, but theres loads of configureations depending on the hight you'd like the keys 
to be from the top of the pannel. Mine sit fairly low.

the PCB is just mounted to the botom of the case with the same vynal standoffs. 
I put screws through the bottom into threaded stand offs and held the pcb to the 
tops with nuts. you can do what you feel comfortable with there.

I put a copy of the PT-10 drawings in the documents folder if somebody needs dimentions for 
some other reason.

The case can be found on mouser here: https://mou.sr/3LkjQmr
